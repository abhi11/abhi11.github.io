I am Abhishek. I live in Pune,India and I love my city. I am an engineering under-grad at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I love programming and I am an open-source enthusiast and try to use everything that is free and open. Some projects that I have done can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abhi11) account.

I love watching movies and some of my favourite directors include Tarantino,Scorsese,Nolan,Anurag Kashyap,Satyajit Ray and so on. But music is my first love. I listen to music of various genres from regional folk to western heavy metal and rock-and-roll. Metallica, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Led Zeppelin ,Opeth, Pink Floyd and Dire Straits are some of the bands I love listening to.
