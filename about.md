I am Abhishek Bhattacharjee. I live in Pune, India and I love my city. I am currently working as an Application Engineer at [Media.Net](http://www.media.net/).
I worked as a Go developer at Betacraft, which was acquired by Media.Net.
Before joining Betacraft, I have worked at Symantec/Veritas for one and half years as a Software Developer. I have completed my bachelor's degree in engineering from Pune Institute of Computer Technology. I love programming and I am an open-source enthusiast and try to use everything that is free and open. Some projects that I have done can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abhi11) account.

I love watching movies and some of my favourite directors include Tarantino, Scorsese, Nolan, Anurag Kashyap, Satyajit Ray and so on. But music is my first love. I listen to music of various genres from regional folk to western heavy metal and rock-and-roll. Metallica, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Led Zeppelin, Opeth, Pink Floyd and Dire Straits are some of the bands I love listening to.
