I am Abhishek Bhattacharjee. Currently living in Tampa, Florida pursuing master of science in Computer Science from the University of South Florida. My areas of interest are distributed systems, web services, architecture design and handling large amounts of data(both structured and unstructured). I am looking for fulltime positions in software development starting summer 2019. I have more than three years of experience in the field of software development primarily in backend. Before joining USF I worked as an Application Engineer at [Media.Net](http://www.media.net/). I also worked for a small startup called BetaCraft as a Go developer which was acquired by Media.Net. I started my career working at Symantec/Veritas for one and half years as a Software Developer. I completed my bachelor in engineering(Information Technology) from Pune Institute of Computer Technology under University of Pune. Some projects that I have done can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abhi11) account. Also check my linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekbhattacharjee11) to know more about my work experience.

I love watching movies and some of my favourite directors include Tarantino, Scorsese, Nolan, Anurag Kashyap, Satyajit Ray and so on. But music is my first love. I listen to music of various genres from regional folk to western heavy metal and rock-and-roll. Metallica, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Led Zeppelin, Opeth, Pink Floyd and Dire Straits are some of the bands I love listening to. Reading is a habit I have developed over the past few years, I love reading historical fiction, philosophy, mythology and some sci-fi. Ayn Rand, Amitav Ghosh, Vladimir Nabokov, Isaac Asimov, Arthur Hailey, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins are some of my favorite authors.
