I am Abhishek Bhattacharjee. Currently living in Tampa, Florida pursuing master of science in Computer Science from the University of South Florida.
I am looking for internship opportunities in summer 2018 in the area of software development. I have three years of experience in the field of software
development. Before joining USF I worked as an Application Engineer at [Media.Net](http://www.media.net/). I also worked for a small startup called BetaCraft as a Go developer which was acquired by Media.Net. Before joining BetaCraft, I have worked at Symantec/Veritas for one and half years as a Software Developer. I have completed my bachelor's degree in engineering from Pune Institute of Computer Technology under University of Pune. I love programming and I am an open-source enthusiast and try to use everything that is free and open. Some projects that I have done can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abhi11) account. Also check my linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekbhattacharjee11) to know more about my work experience.

I love watching movies and some of my favourite directors include Tarantino, Scorsese, Nolan, Anurag Kashyap, Satyajit Ray and so on. But music is my first love. I listen to music of various genres from regional folk to western heavy metal and rock-and-roll. Metallica, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Led Zeppelin, Opeth, Pink Floyd and Dire Straits are some of the bands I love listening to.
